# Void Walker
Code Platoon Uniform Group Project:
Project: Top-Down Rogue-like 2D RPG game made with the Godot Game Engine and GDScript


DESCRIPTION:
This project represented the culmination of our cohort's efforts. We made a decision to depart from the conventional path of developing another full-stack application and instead ventured into the realm of game development, a subject not covered in our course curriculum. The utilization of the Godot game engine posed a significant challenge as it was unfamiliar to 90% of our team. Our team comprised five other developers, each assigned specific roles in the project's execution.

This game offers a brief experience taking players on a journey with a resurrected knight who must battle his way to survival in the world of the living.

Our most formidable obstacle in this endeavor was the necessity to learn on the job. The entire project was completed within a tight two-week timeframe, with the initial days dedicated to extensive tutorial exploration and online research.

Beyond grappling with our relative inexperience in using the Godot game engine, we were also confronted with the complexities of managing merge conflicts. Adding to the challenge was our limited familiarity with version control systems. Notably, Godot's integration with GitHub was less than user-friendly, necessitating a collaborative effort to resolve merge conflicts using various techniques. Two weeks later, countless of Code Reviews and solving merge conflicts. We can confidently say that we are more than comfortable on solving any merge conflicts that may arise
