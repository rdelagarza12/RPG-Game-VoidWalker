Code Platoon Uniform Group Project:
Project: Top-Down Rogue-like 2D RPG game made with the Godot Game Engine and GDScript


DESCRIPTION:
  This project represented the culmination of our cohort's efforts. We made a decision to depart from the conventional path of developing another full-stack application and instead ventured into the realm of game development, a subject not covered in our course curriculum. The utilization of the Godot game engine posed a significant challenge as it was unfamiliar to 90% of our team. Our team comprised five other developers, each assigned specific roles in the project's execution.

This game offers a brief experience taking players on a journey with a resurrected knight who must battle his way to survival in the world of the living.

Our most formidable obstacle in this endeavor was the necessity to learn on the job. The entire project was completed within a tight two-week timeframe, with the initial days dedicated to extensive tutorial exploration and online research.

Beyond grappling with our relative inexperience in using the Godot game engine, we were also confronted with the complexities of managing merge conflicts. Adding to the challenge was our limited familiarity with version control systems. Notably, Godot's integration with GitHub was less than user-friendly, necessitating a collaborative effort to resolve merge conflicts using various techniques. Two weeks later, countless of Code Reviews and solving merge conflicts. We can confidently say that we are more than comfortable on solving any merge conflicts that may arise

Contributions:

In this project, I played a pivotal role in shaping the main protagonist of our game and crafting the graphical user interface (GUI). I embarked on the task of developing the player character's physics system entirely from the ground up, including defining intricate interactions with in-game adversaries. One of the most demanding aspects of my work with the protagonist was ensuring a seamless and enjoyable player experience while eliminating any potential glitches.

Our initial steps involved establishing basic movement mechanics, which were subsequently enriched with additional features such as a sword dash and a wide-area skill to enhance the character's mobility and combat capabilities. Once the player character was fully functional, my focus shifted towards integrating it with the game maps and the GUI. This integration involved creating a seamless connection between the character's health, mana, and damage attributes through a global script, which in turn was harmoniously linked with the GUI for a cohesive player experience.

Takeaways:

This project proved to be a valuable learning experience, significantly enhancing my proficiency in working with version control systems and collaborating within a group dynamic. Given the relatively nascent integration of GitHub with the Godot game engine, we encountered a higher frequency of merge conflicts and operational challenges than we might have in the context of a more traditional full-stack application, as typically covered in Code Platoon's curriculum. This experience has honed my ability to navigate complex collaborative environments and reinforced my adaptability in the face of emerging technologies and associated challenges.
