# Void Walker
Code Platoon Uniform Group Project:
Project: Top-Down Rogue-like 2D RPG game made with the Godot Game Engine and GDScript

This Game was the culmination project for our Cohort. We decided to take a different route for our group project. Instead of doing another Full-Stack Application 
we decided to try our luck with something that was not taught at our course, Game Development. The Godot game engine was foreign to 90% of our team. The team consisted of 5
other Developers, in which the roles were distributed. This Game takes you through a quick experience of a knight who suddenly resurrected back to the world of the living and must fight his way out to survive.
This biggest hurdle that we had encountered was learning on the job. The entire project was done in a span of two weeks with the first couple days consisting of tutorials and research online.
Aside from the Game Engine being Foreign to us, we were now confronted with consisting merge conflicts. On top of us being new to working with Version Control Systems, Godot is fairly new
to the Github scene and does not have a good user-friendly interaction.
